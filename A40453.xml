            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>My wish is this Book be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read by Roman Catholicks, and by Proteſtants; the firſt will likely be well ſatisfyed with
<pb facs="tcp:49335:10"/> this my endevours; and from the proteſtant reader I only pray, that hee will be pleaſed with atention and without prejudging to read all, and after to ſpeak with God alone about the ſtate of his owne Soule, and what Religion hee will Chuſe for his eternall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The argument I doe not handle Scholaſtically conceiving not that the better way to haue my ſence rightly underſtood; I am for the way of fact decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reing ingeniouſly what happen'd in England upon the comming in of both Religions; what kinde of men were inſtrumentall in bringing them in; what theire
<pb facs="tcp:49335:10"/> manners, vertues or vices; who of them were of Sanctity, and who not; who of them wrought Miracles, which are Evident ſignes of true Religion, which was brought into all Kingdoms Countrys and Provinces by Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and Miracles.</p>
            <p>I deny what Sall falling from his faith (who gave me the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of writing) afirms, to witt. <hi>That the Roman Catholick Religion is repugnant to humaine reaſon.</hi> It were to make Religion fabulous and foolish, to ſay it is contrary to wiſdome and reaſon, for what can be oppoſitt to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and reaſon, but folly and fables? As Scripture (by which

            <p>To ſpeak of both Religions, Catholick and Proreſtant, and which of them is ſafeſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <pb facs="tcp:49335:14"/> is the ſafeſt, which is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Jugment, that the Roman is the fafeſt of all, much like that the grave Judges gave for the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> when all the Provinces of Greece claimed for the Palm and praiſe in the glorious victory they obtained againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians. Thoſe excellent Judges, before whome the cauſe was brought, demanded of every one of them, whome they thought to have deſerued beſt after themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues; and all anſwering, that the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> the wiſe Iudges gave ſentence, that indeed the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had deſerued beſt of al the praiſe and glory of all, in
<pb facs="tcp:49335:15"/> that victory. In the ſame kinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and for the ſame reaſon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion preferr'd by all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves, before all others, is realy to be preferred to all as the beſt and ſafeſt.</p>
            <p>I will here make an end, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting you my proteſtant Reader to lay aſide paſſion, and read the contents of this little worke. (<hi>Sall's confutation</hi>) with as great diligence as you can for your owne good; if you are a Zealous Proteſtant, you will doe ſoe, for of thoſe I found many ſo great frinds of truth, as they would change theire owne Religion, if they were once perſwaded it were
<pb facs="tcp:49335:15"/> not true, and ſome of them I haue known, that after diligent ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for truth in Religion, and finding it, (where it was to be found) in the Roman Catholick Church, Imbraced our Religion, and after all theire life tyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd ſincerly all paynes and care for the Converſion of theire once Bretheren in Proteſtaniſme.</p>
            <p>I neuer eſteemed, or loved men cold in theire owne Religion, (ſome I haue knowne of that kinde Catholicks, and Proteſtants, who tuned theire faith to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and wordly reſpects.) I haue bine aquainted with ſom zealous, learned Proteſtants and good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:49335:16"/> men, with thoſe I willingly conferr'd, and haue been deare to ſome of them. One there was a Proteſtant Arch-Deacon of the Dioces I liu'd in, hee had alſoe a temporall eſtate, and was Rector or parſon of a great Parish of ſom thouſands of ſoules, wherin I had care of the Catholick ſoules; of all thoſe hee had but a few to looke unto, ſcarce a dozen beſides his owne family, the sharing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us was, that hee had the flees, and I the flock, and ſoe farr wee were from Enuying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that wee joy'd in any thing, that happend well to each other: hee was one of the beſt morall
<pb facs="tcp:49335:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> men I haue ever knowne, a milde, courteous and mercifull perſon. It was my good luck (and truly agreat pleaſure) to haue found an occaſion of doing a good, and great ſervice to one of his Infants after his death, in the firſt yeare of the warrs, which I did (God is my wittnes) with all harty willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I haue bin informed that the Mother then at <hi>Dubblin,</hi> (a wel bred Creature) hearing of my kindneſs to her Child ſaid, that worthy Churchman, and my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band haue much loved one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hee hath shew'd his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by effect to the Child of the deceaſed: I pray God I may

I should be glad this little worke of myne might fall into the hands of ſuch Proteſtants, as my deare frind was.

               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Roman Catholick Faith,</hi> is that only true faith, wherin men are to be ſaued, is evidently confirmed, for that it is taught and defended only in the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> which hath the true ſignes and propertys of a true Church, for that shee is one only, and can not be many; that shee is viſible; and viſibly diſperſed over the whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49335:37"/> world, and therfore Catholick and Univerſall; that shee is infallible and can not be deceived, nor deceive, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in her Doctrin upon the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Revelation of God, being aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with Chriſt's promiſe of the perpetuall preſence of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> with her, and conſequently can neuer faile or fall into error; that shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not only the good, or the elect in this life, but alſoe divers wicked members, as the barne doth both wheat and chaff; that likewiſe shee hath continued perpetually viſible from Chriſt to our days by manifeſt Succeſſions of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> knowne to the world, and shall ſoe to the end; that there is noe hope of ſalvation out of this Church, and without this Faith, though aman live otherwiſe neuer ſoe well, or give neuer ſoe much <hi>Almes,</hi> or give even his blood, or ſuffer neuer ſoe much for Chriſt his name.</p>
               <p>Wee know there are ſome that ſay, and hold, that Catholicks and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49335:37"/> Proteſtants can be ſau'd each in his owne Religion; But that is a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Opinion, and the refuge of a very Carleſs Conſcience, if not voyd of all faith: Noe Catholick is of this mind, they are only Proteſtants that ſay ſoe, for wee Catholicks hold with the Fathers of the Church, that ſalvation is only, (as before was ſaid) to be found in the Catholick Church, among others <hi>Sainct Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertulian</hi> neare the Apoſtles tyme, and after them <hi>Epiphanius, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Saint Auguſtin,</hi> doe ſpecially treat of this matter. The reaſon is evident, in as much as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and Proteſtants doe diſagree in ſubſtantiall <hi>Articles</hi> and Theorems of Chriſtian faith, theire diſagreements being knowne to be in above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred points great and ſmall; partly about the God-head of Chriſt; his Church, head, members, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therof in his deſcent to hell; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinns; all which are <hi>Articles</hi> of the common Creed; partly about the <hi>Sacraments</hi> both of theire nature,

All which are knowne to be very ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall points.</p>
               <p>It is therfore very abſurd, and plainly tending to a ſecret kinde of <hi>Athiſme,</hi> to uphold the Catholick and Proteſtant Religion doe not differ in ſubſtantiall points; and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence being ſuppoſed (as it muſt be) it is an <hi>Hereſy</hi> to hould the Catholicks and Proteſtants may be ſau'd each in his owne Religion and Profeſſion; but Catholicks can be ſau'd in theirs, which can not be ſaid of the Proteſtant and his for being out of the Arke, <hi>Debet perire</hi> (as <hi>Saint Jerom</hi> ſays) <hi>regnante deluvio.</hi>

               <p>The laſt motive (the 12. which is moſt to be conſidered of all, in order to ſafty) is that Salvation may be had in the Catholick Religion, even by the Confeſſions of Proteſtant Devines and Writers, (and likely ſome of them have ſigned the XXXIX. <hi>Articles</hi>) whence hee Derives an undeniable Conſequence, that the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the ſafeſt: hee diſcourſeth to this purpoſe; both the ſides and the learnedeſt of both the ſides Confeſs and agree ſalvation can be obtained in the Roman Catholick Faith, that ſame faith which hath beene profeſſed and maintaned, by <hi>Popes, Catholick Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Congregations</hi> directed and governed by them in <hi>Spiritualibus;</hi> in Confirmation of which the Catholick Saints in our Littanys, are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for Saints by the Proteſtants; but all the Catholick ſide hould that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants cannot be ſaued in theire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (the Religion of the XXXIX. <hi>Articles.</hi>) Ergo (ſaith <hi>Doctor King</hi>) it is Wiſdome and the ſafeſt way to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

               <head>XVIII. CHAPTER. The Doctrin of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation defended againſt Sall a new Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</head>
               <p>THere is noe Proteſtant ſoe maddly obſtinate, as to give <hi>God</hi> the lye to his face and in plaine tearms to ſay, though hee did know <hi>God</hi> did reveale the Doctrin of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as the Church of Rome doth propoſe and maintaine it, I would not beleeve it: noe; all Proteſtants acknowledg (and generally all Hereticks) <hi>God</hi> to bee truth it ſelfe, and not able to deceive, or bee deceived.</p>
               <p>The obſtinacy therfore of Proteſtants againſt <hi>Gods</hi> verityes is not as they are uttered immediatly by himſelfe, but as they are propoſed by his Church, as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49335:142"/> in the point of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation Sall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lately a Proteſtant doth not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the Catholick Church propoſing that Doctrin as revealed by <hi>God, but ſays it is not warranted by devine writt,</hi> (the ſame hee ſays of <hi>Indulgences, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> worship of Images &amp;c.) <hi>but introduced and made an</hi> Article <hi>of faith by the uſe and Authority of the Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt cleare evidence there can be noe obſtinacy, the object of it muſt be involved in ſome obſcurity, otherwiſe the will (which is the ſource of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy) would not bee able to maſter the underſtanding. There is nothing more cleare and evident to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then this propoſition. <hi>If God ſaid or revealed any thing its very true.</hi> The obſtinacy therfore of Hereticks doth not conteſt with this cleare and confeſſed truth. It only doubts, or denyes, that <hi>God</hi> ſaid or revealed any ſuch thing as the Church pretends.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, in what <hi>Sall</hi> and I doe differ about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:49335:143"/> for hee doth not beleeve the Church propoſing and defyning the Doctrin therof, as revealed by <hi>God.</hi> The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick beleeves, what the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, as revealed, <hi>only conditionally; if God reveal'd it,</hi> reſerving to his owne privat Iudgment, or to that of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat <hi>Patriarks Luther, Zwinglius, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> &amp;c. this determination; but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Abſolutly,</hi> and doubts not, but <hi>God</hi> revealed, what the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as revealed, ſubmitting his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in matters of Faith) to what ſoever the Church doth define, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>This is the caſe of Hereticks. They proteſt, if they had thought or beleeved, that the Doctrin of the Roman Church in controverted points, were revealed by <hi>God,</hi> they would hartily imbrace it; but they doe not conſider this very if, or <hi>doubt</hi> is Hereſie: for they have noe reaſon to doubt, but that the Roman Catholick Church hath Commiſſion and power of defining and declaring what is revealed by <hi>God,</hi> ſeeing it hath the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49335:143"/> evident ſignes of a true Church, as <hi>Miracles, Sanctity of Doctrin and Life, continuall Succeſſion</hi> (from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the preſent age) <hi>both of Paſtors and Doctrin.</hi> Theſe ſignes may be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and knowne by all people, as Clownes, Souldiers, and other illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons: let them examin the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of theire owne Countryes, and the Religion of theire Anceſters, which ſoever amongſt all the Chriſtians Churches, had, and hath the aforeſaid ſignes; that Church muſt be heard, obeyed, and beleeved, as having <hi>Gods</hi> Authority and Commiſſion, to deſide all doubts, and Controverſies of Faith; who ſoever beleeves not her diffini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and obeys not her decrees and Canons in points of Faith is an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Heretick; and ſuch is <hi>Sall</hi> having deſerted and condemned this Church.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sall</hi> tells us the Doctrin of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> is a novelty, not found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but brought into the Church by the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> anno 1215. This is a great mistake in <hi>Sall:</hi> The
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49335:144"/> very condemning of <hi>Berengarius</hi> as an Heretick for impugning <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> anno 1050, (which was before the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> 165. years) proves it was noe novelty, but an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith before that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell<note place="margin">There were preſent at this Counſell the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Roman and Greek: and of the Kings of France, Spaine, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perus. their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors.</note> euen from the Apoſtles tymes.

The Canon, or Diffinition of that great Councell was: In haec Verba. <hi>Verum Chriſti Corpus, &amp; ſanguis in hoc Sacramento Altaris ſub ſpeciebus Panis &amp; Vini ver aceter continentur Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatis Pane in Corpus &amp; Vino in Sanguinem poteſtate divina</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better declaring of this truth,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49335:144"/> 
                  <hi>Sall</hi> you know the Church doth not make new <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith, when it defines any controverted Doctrin; It only declares that ſuch Doctrin was delivered to the primative Church, and ſoe downe along to us, and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth its difinition upon <hi>Scripture</hi> or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Tradition. As the Proteſtants object againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that it is a nouelty; Soe did the <hi>Arrians</hi> againſt <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> that it was a novelty brought in by the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> wheras ſaid Councell did only define <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> to have been from the Apoſtles tyme, an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith, and decreed the ſame should be declared and ſignify'd by the word <hi>Omouſion,</hi> in like manner the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> did define for a miſtery of faith <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> which was ſoe before theire Difinition, and then they agreed upon the word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but the thing by that word ſignifyed was before beleeved as an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith by the whole Church, though expreſſed in other tearms, as thoſe of <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49335:145"/> Tranſmutation, Tranſelementation, Converſion</hi> of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Bloud of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean tyme I can not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how <hi>Sall</hi> a new <hi>Sacramentarian</hi> should diſpute with us about the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſeing hee ſlatt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyes the Body and Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be realy, and ſubſtantially preſent in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> What is more imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then to diſpute of the manner of a thing, or being, that you hould has noe being?

               <p>The firſt Hereticks that impugned <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> were the <hi>Capharnites,</hi> who ſaid: <hi>Quomodo poteſt hic nobis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>

                  <hi>Sall</hi> you ſee by this is becom a <hi>Caphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> and in this point ſoe are all that imbrace the XXXIX. <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the yeare 780. certaine Greek Hereticks called <hi>Iconomachi,</hi> held this <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be only an Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that his Body was not realy in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> In the yeare 800. one <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Scotus</hi> of the Latin Church, fell into the ſame Hereſie, and after him two ages and more, in the year 1050, <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> denyed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Real-Preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before theſe men, none did impugne this high miſtery of Faith, but all the Church did quietly and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously

                  <p>MOre then twenty years agoe, I lighted upon a Book written by a

In his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation hee was a meer Publican, and moſt vaine, lying, vapering, inſolent debauſt, and Drunkeneſt Companion that was knowne in thoſe parts. As ſoon as the Rebellion began in <hi>England</hi> hee bid a Deiu to his Loyalty, went to <hi>England,</hi> and ſtuck to thoſe then in Rebellion, thinking therby to make a great Fortune, came over with <hi>Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and was a meer ſcourge, and plague to the Catholick Clergy, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldiers and wicked men to the Houſes of all the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> hee knew:
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49335:218"/> Infine hee dyed of the plague in a Ditch deſerted of all of both Religions crying (as they ſay) for a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but found none.</p>
                     <p>The other was a home-bred man native of our owne parts, unlearned but witty, hee had beene in the Order of <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> when hee dy'd 70. years, (they ſaid hee was a <hi>Queen Mary Prieſt.</hi>) I came to him upon his dying-bed in <hi>November</hi> 1639. and did my beſt to bring him to a true beliefe, and uſed to that effect, obliging tearmes as I conceiu'd, I earneſtly deſired him to make a ſound Act of Contrition and confeſſe his ſins penitently for reconciling himſelfe to <hi>God,</hi> I told him hee was not taken for an Heretick, but for one that willfully went out of the Church, and forſook his Maſter, (not for feare as <hi>Peeter</hi> did) but to live with a woeman in Luſt and Sacriledge, and to injoy the pleaſures, and commodityes of the World; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, I told him I would ingage my Soule under <hi>God</hi> for his Salvation, if hee would then turne to <hi>God</hi> and true
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49335:218"/> Faith with a true Repentance for his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and have harty Contrition: I pray'd him to think on the good theefe, that lived wickedly untill his laſt Houre, and yet when hee ſaid, even then, with repentance and love: <hi>Domine memento mei dum veneris in Regnum tuum,</hi> hee heard that comfortable voyce of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Ieſus, Hodie mecum eris in Paradiſo.</hi> I did all I was able to doe, and wept bitter tears to ſee if I could gaine this Soule, and peerce his ſtony hart, but all in Vaine, for hee gave mee noe good anſwer, but very hard words, and cal'd mee Hypocrit and what not; his words did not trouble mee, but the diſpairing ſtate of the mans Soule gave mee great Affliction of minde. At length I told him in ſevere words, that I would ariſe againſt him in the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to give Teſtimony of his rejecting Gods Grace offered him at that tyme for ſauing his Soule; what was the ende of my ſincere Exhortation, Prayers, and Tears? the man roaring out and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impious words, turn'd his face to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49335:219"/> the Wale, and even in that Inſtant loſt his witts. <hi>God</hi> knows with how ſad a hart I parted from him; one of his Daughters, a Catholick that liu'd with him, came to mee weeping, and crying: O Reverend Father, what of my Father, will hee come of? I have ſeen him (ſaid shee) often ſaying his Canonicall Houres, and did uſe to hide his <hi>Breviary</hi> in a ſecret place, I replyed, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath willfully violated his <hi>holy Vowes,</hi> hee hath liu'd in Sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge aboue 64. yeares, hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>God</hi> and all Godlineſs, and <hi>God</hi> hath (I may well feare it) abandoned him in this tyme of his departure out of the world.

                  <p>I pray did not <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his bands runn into a Rebellion? why ſoe? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with thoſe, that follow'd him, hee shaked of all Obedience to the <hi>King,</hi> and to the Lawes of the Land, hee contemned the Goverment, and made himſelfe and his party, a Body by themſelves, a Body apart, and though hee gayned all the Cittys, and Townes, inſlaved Free-men, and acted the worſt Treaſon Imaginable, by putting to death his <hi>Leage-Lord</hi> and <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> noe man for all this can affirme that this great power hee had, and ſoe many

                  <p>This is our very caſe. <hi>England,</hi> all the World knowes, once owned the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> not only for the firſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, but alſoe ſupreme head of the Vniverſall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church;</hi> It admitted of this Churche's Diſcipline and Law, and yielded Obedience to it: It communicated with the Roman Church, as well in points of Faith, as in the uſe of Rites, Liturgy's, and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yet for all this, they have shaken of all Obedience to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and if this bee not a willfull formall <hi>Separation</hi> of theire part let any man judge.
